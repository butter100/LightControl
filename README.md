# LightControl
A short experimental Python script for Windows that aims to adjust monitor brightness and contrast based on the time of the day.
The goal is to reduce eyestrain and improve circadian rhythms by reducing screen light emission during night time.
The program gradually increases/decreases brightness and contrast so there's always a smooth transition.

Must be left running continuously to function as intended.
CSV must be in the same path with .py file for code to run without any changes.
